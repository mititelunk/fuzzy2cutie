fuzzy2cutie (libfuzzy2cutie.so)
===========
If you do not know how to ask for hot coffee at "PostgreSQL" - this is for you.

If you do not like coffee, then Study the fuzzy logic.

And your wife will give me a cake for the fact that now you spend the night at home.

This add-on "PostgreSQL" for "jFuzzyQt" (dynamic link library)

1) Download and install "jFuzzyQt" from "sourceforge.net";

2) on a version of "PostgreSQL-9.1/9.2" - certainly works;

3) "Makefile" or "Qt Creator" - created a libfuzzy2cutie.so;

4) libfuzzy2cutie.so copy "/ postgresql/9.1/lib" (where all the other libraries);

5) create function in the "PostgreSQL" (instruction in fuzzy2cutie.sql) write your FCL and SQL-script (like me);

6) If you set "jFuzzyQt", then you read "INSTALL" and know about the "Optimization" for FCL.
